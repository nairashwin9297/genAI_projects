## Learning Progression

Started with **Traditional ML algorithms** like Naive Bayes and SVMs for text classification to understand the fundamentals. Then moved towards **RAG systems** to prevent LLM hallucinations and ground responses in factual sources. Explored **GANs**, the older way of image generation, implementing DCGANs for realistic image synthesis. Advanced to **LLM fine-tuning** with CodeT5 and FLAN-T5 for specialized tasks like text-to-SQL conversion. Progressed to latest tech with **LLM orchestration using AutoGen** for distributed multi-agent systems. Finally concluded with **Diffusion Models**, the current state-of-the-art generative approach that powers modern AI image generation tools.
